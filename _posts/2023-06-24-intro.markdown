Hi, my name is James Maddux, and I'm completing a CS degree at WGU, which I expect to finish in 2024. I have the following goals for this blog:
- Become more familiar with GitHub
- Share resources with other CS students (especially my WGU classmates)
- Highlight projects I'm working on
- Have a place to play around with minor web development

The installation of the Jekyll theming onto this GitHub page was a nice little exercise. If you want to give it a try yourself, check out
the [Jekyll guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). It won't be a comprehensive guide, and you will likely need to work on chunks of the installation that 
you haven't seen before, but it's worthwhile to troubleshoot. 

Not that this blog is a complete product at the moment! Consider the structure of this website a work
in progress, but I hope to be streamlining it as time goes by. The theming is courtesy of the hard work by the Jekyll folks. It's also quite nice
to have an RSS feed running again, especially as social networks bog down with spam and poorly-targeted ads.

Thank you for stopping by!
