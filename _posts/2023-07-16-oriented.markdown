After a month of waiting, I finally got to make progress on my coursework, sort of.
I completed the orientation for starting the program, which becomes available after
the 15th day of the month prior to your start date. The orientation is standard
fare, with a jumble of motivational tidbits, a career test, post-login website navigation,
and branches for each program. At the end, they give you an assignment to "pass" the
orientation, which just has a few questions about your plans.

Sometime in the next couple weeks, I'll be assigned a Program Mentor who will guide
me through the curriculum and get my classes in a proper order. They will be communicating
with me regularly though the program (currently weekly calls, but I've heard that
this may change). Then I start my program on August 1st, though the first day can be
a bit chaotic with access, from what I've seen in discussion groups.

Other than that, today I am re-entering module 5 of the Java MOOC I posted about earlier,
which means that yes, somehow I did the equivalent of 40 hours of of the MOOC so far.
Not a bad benchmark.

I have also started the "WGU Info" page, which will contain links and resources
that myself and other students have found helpful when going through the CS program.
This will be an ongoing project, but hopefully a nice stop for other WGU CS students!
