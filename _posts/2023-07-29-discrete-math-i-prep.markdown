Although I am still waiting for that August 1st start date, the last couple weeks have been productive. My program mentor helped me organize my classes on the 18th, and we established that I will work on Discrete Math first. 

I'm looking forward to tackling a new math subject for the first time in years. Two YouTube playlists are often recommended by other students: one by [TrevTutor](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDDGPdw7e6Ag1EIznZ-m-qXu4XX3A0cIz) and another by [Prof. Kim Brehm from Bellevue](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz). I went with the Brehm lectures, completing three-quarters of the videos so far. She also based her lectures on Rosen's Discrete Mathematics 7e, which can be found via PDF's hosted on different universities' websites.

Today, I went ahead and took the pre-assessment for WGU's Discrete Math I, and I got around 70%. Not nearly as well as I want to do, but much of the actual course content is still inaccessible until I officially start the class, so I am pleased with that result. The pre-assessment also did a good job of outlining areas for me to focus on.

Other than that, yes, I did pause on the Java MOOC to study math. I will be returning to Java shortly, and hopefully getting into shape for praticing Leetcode exercises!
