Quick update, but life has changed fairly drastically in the past month!

For one, I did accept a position with a local IT group this week, and it seems like a fairly forward-thinking group that is innovating its systems. They might even have a good spot (evenutally) for someone with a CS degree around the time I finish. Things can always change, but this does mean I may slow down a bit with school, as WGU *kind of* allows students to set their own pace.

Otherwise, Discrete Math is going pretty well. I have improved my pre-assessment score over the past couple weeks, and I could probably pass the test if I attempted it today, but I'd like to get a solid foundation on certain concepts before I take the actual test. This weekend should provide some solid study sessions, and we'll see what kind of confidence I can build.
