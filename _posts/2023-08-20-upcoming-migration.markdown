With Google Domains selling to SquareSpace, I'm moving forward with getting my pragmaddux.com domain transferred out. The domain only transfers to my GitHub page right now, so no great confusions. I may buy hosting external to GitHub as well, marking a relative end to this blog being relatively updated.

This blog was pretty fun to set up, and it has given me some experience with GitHub. Overall, I do miss the utility of Wordpress, so I will likely go that route in setting up a new blog/page. You are also not supposed to use GitHub pages for affiliate links or monetization, and while that may be circumventable, I'd rather move things to a new site.

Actually, I plan on moving toward a couple sites. One would be for the blog and portfolio, nothing too complicated. 

The second would be resources for WGU students, giving a central place that can be shared. It's often a bit difficult to navigate WGU, and I would like to host a nice, central and unofficial resource for students. Monetization, while limited, would be present through affiliate links. There are also referral codes for WGU applications, where prospective students get their application fee waived, and I would get gift cards for the WGU merch store. I don't see it generating much income, but it might be a portfolio-worthy project, and I do like the idea of helping classmates.
