Actually, after a year or so, I didn't find much reason to continue with WordPress. For one, I have been busy with school over the past year, and blogging fell by the wayside. And two, I'm not so enamored with WP right now given recent weirdness, even though I expect it to remain relevant for a while longer. This Jekyll implementation of the blog is functional for now. The wonderful part of Markdown formatting is how portable these posts become, and that's part of why I've been using Obsidian for note-taking these days.

Regarding school, I've completed the bulk of my degree since the last post. It will have taken three six-month terms to do so, and I am targeting a December 2024 finish to have my capstone finished.

I had planned on documenting my experiences class-by-class, but there are much better resources than a stationary blog. The biggest one has been [this 3,500-member Discord,](https://discord.com/invite/wgu), which I joined last February and now help moderate. WGU is currently prepping to update the BSCS, which will introduce new AI-focused classes. Because of this update, I strongly advise future students to find a study group and regularly communicate with WGU staff and mentors. The Reddit posts and Youtube videos are nice, but often outdated.

Other than all that, it has been an excellent journey since committing to my CS degree. I had the chance to attend our local BSides earlier this year, and last week I made it out to Thunderplains/Innotech over in Oklahoma City. While I'm still on the hunt, my confidence is building and I'm looking forward to making professional contributions wherever I end up!

Housekeeping stuff - I do plan on updating some things on this blog, especially the helpful links. Another thing I'm growing more passionate about is highlighting cool work that other people are doing in tech, so I'd anticipate links and other fun things in the future.
