Hi, my name is James Maddux, and I'm completing
a CS degree at WGU, which I expect to finish
in 2024. I started this "blog" to become more
familiar with GitHub, share resources for other
WGU CS students, and highlight projects that 
I am working on.

Consider the structure of this website a work
in progress, but I hope to be streamlining it 
as time goes by. The theming is courtesy of the
hard work by the Jekyll folks.

Thank you for stopping by!
